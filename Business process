Business process: 

Our project’s main goal is to implement a database for an online bookstore called ‘Kitap Market’. 

Firstly, book issuers are supplying us with books they published. After that, customers, readers could order books from our market after
they chose what they liked. In order to be executed bookstore administrators must know addresses of their customers, we must mention that
one reader could have more than one living address. So, the customer is making an order, and our employee takes that order, after all operations
are correct, the reader makes a payment.  Every employee in our company has unique contacts. After all these operations are executed we start 
to deliver our customers’ orders with any type or transportation. And finally, we have happy readers and happy company.
