Issuer table

1NF
The Issuer info table is in the first normal form since all of the table's characteristics contain just one datum in each row, 
rather than numerous in one.

2NF 
All characteristics are dependent on the primary key, which causes the table to be in the second normal form.All attributes 
(issuer_country, issuer_name, issued_books_quantity), with the exception of the main key, allow for repetition of data on a single line.

3NF

Because there is no transitive relationship between the attributes, the table is in third normal form. That is, in the issuer_country table, 
issuer_country is independent of issuer_name, because one country can have multiple issuers.




Kitap table

1NF
The Kitap table features a single datum in each row rather than multiples, suggesting that it is in the first normal form.

2NF 
All attributes are dependent on the primary key, which causes the table to be in the second normal form.The data for all attributes—issuer_id(FK), 
kitap_title, pages, and release_date—other than the primary key can be repeated on a single line.

3NF 
In the KITAP table, the ISBN number is utilized as the main key to uniquely identify each book. The main key determines the columns issuer_id,
kitap_title, pages, and release_date. The table has no indirect dependencies, making it conform to the third normal form (3NF).








Tapsyrys_info table
1NF
The delivery table fits under the first normal form because there is just one set of data in each row. As a result, there is an atomic value 
for each column in this table.


2NF 
The table takes on its second normal form. It does not contradict its guiding principle (all attributes must be dependent on the primary key). 
We have repeated isbn, but the prices of these book vary. As a result, both attributes are dependent on info_id.

3NF

The table belongs to the third normal form. The table must not contain transitive dependencies between attributes, according to the third normal 
form principle. And the table doesn't break it because there's no transitive dependency between info_id, isbn, and price.





Qyzmetker table

1NF
The Qyzmetker table is in the first normal form because all attributes of the table have only one datum in each row, not several in one.

2NF 
The table is in the second normal form because all attributes depend on the primary key.Because all attributes except the primary key ( name, surname) 
their data  can be repeated.
For example, take the attribute first name, as you already know, there are people with the same first name also in rare cases with the same last name. 
Even rarer are people with the same first and last name, but it is possible. But the identifier will never be repeated

3NF 
Because there is no transitive relationship between the attributes, the table is in third normal form. For example, the attribute "name" is 
independent of the attribute "surname" (both can be repeated)





Qyzmetker_contact table

1NF
The Qyzmetker_contact table is in the first normal form because all attributes of the table have only one datum in each row, not several in one.

2NF 
The table is in the second normal form because all attributes depend on the primary key.Because all attributes except the primary key 
( qyzmetker_id(FK), phone_no, email),  their data  can be repeated.
Example: One worker can have a work phone and his own personal phone. qyzmekter_id can use corporate mail, which can be accessed by several 
people, as well as personal mail So only the contact id remains unrepeatable


3NF
Because there is no transitive relationship between the attributes, the table is in third normal form. Example: With qyzmetker_id we can find 
two phone or email addresses. And with email we can find several qyzmetker_id which can be used by several people (one work email). In this way 
the non-key attributes depend only on the primary key



Tapsyrys table:

1NF
The Tapsyrys table is in the first normal form because all attributes of the table have only one datum in each row, not several in one.

2NF 
The table is in the second normal form because all attributes depend on the primary key.Because all attributes except the primary key
(tapsyrys_date, oqyrman_id(FK), delivery_id(FK), qyzmetker_id(FK),
meken-zhay_id(FK)), their data can be repeated. For example, one customer can make several purchases to the same address on the same day, 
and one employee can take several orders.So it all depends on the tapsyrys_id.

3NF
The table is in the third normal form because it does not have a transitive relationship between attributes.That is, for example, in the
table meken_zhay_id does not depend on oqyrman_id, as one address can be several people (for example, family members).


Delivery table:
1NF
Because there are just one set of data in each row of the delivery table, it falls under the first normal form. Consequently, every column in 
this table has an atomic value.


2NF
The table enters the second normal form. It does not violate its principle (all attributes must depend on the primary key). We have delivery 
types that are repeated, but the costs of this delivery are different. Accordingly, both attributes depend on delivery_id.

3NF
The table is part of the third normal form. Principle of the third normal form: the table must not contain transitive dependencies between 
attributes. And the table does not violate it, because there is no transitive dependence between delivery_id - delivery_type - expense.

Oqyrman table:
1NF
The rules of the first normal form: The table should not contain duplicate rows, each cell of the table stores one non-compound value.
And these rules are not violated by the table, so it is included in this normal form.

2NF
For a table to be in 2NF , we must have a primary key and all attributes must depend on it. We have the buyer's first name, last name and mail. 
The first and last names can be repeated in rare cases. And also for example in one family there are cases when they use the same mail. Accordingly, 
it may be repeated. So all the attributes depend on the id. 

3NF
The cases with attributes were described above, which means that there cannot be a transitive relationship between them.

Meken_zhay table:

In this table, each row has non-component values, which means that it is in 1NF.All attributes we have depend only on the primary key 
(meken_zhay_id). And we have no transitive dependencies between attributes. Which means that the table is both in 2NF and in 3NF.


Tolem table

1NF
The Tolem table is in the first normal form because all attributes of the table have only one datum in each row, not several in one.

2NF 
The table is in the second normal form because all attributes depend on the primary key.Because all attributes except the primary key 
(status, oqyrman_id(FK), total_amount, payment_type, created_date),  their data  can be repeated.

Example: One oqyrman_id can make a purchase for a different amount on several occasions. From this we can conclude that with oqyrman_id you can 
find several lines of data. This also applies to other attributes


3NF
Because there is no transitive relationship between the attributes, the table is in third normal form. Example: You will not be able to find a 
non-key attribute with a non-key attribute (the data will be repeated). Only tolem_id can primary key
